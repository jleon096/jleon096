        <p class="lead mb-4">Every summer my family and I take a trip to Disneyland, my happiest place on Earth. Gorging myself on delicious treats and riding thrilling rides inspired by my beloved Disney movies is my ideal way to spend time with my family. My love for the House of Mouse extends beyond just visiting the parks; I devour any behind the scenes content I can get, such as The Imagineering Story on Disney+. Questions like, ‚ÄúWhat makes each ride so appealing?,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow can they constantly update and improve their parks so that boredom does not settle in?‚Äù all swirl in my brain. Joining the AP Capstone program allows me to take advantage of exploring my passion in an academic setting. I knew I wanted to tie my interest in the psychological phenomenon of people and my love for Disneyland together. In my preliminary research I found that many Disney adults are judged for loving Disneyland because it is a ‚Äúchild's theme park.‚Äù  My research also revealed adults make their jobs their top priority leading to the workaholism attitude. I continued to research the mentality and metacognitive thinking of adults and found Erik Erikson‚Äôs Psychosocial stages of life. As I investigated Erikson‚Äôs psychosocial stages, I took special interest in the adolescent stage because as a teenager I too am trying to discover my identity and how I want to pursue my future. Coming across this theory was the missing piece to my puzzle; Erikson discusses adults ages 45-60 as  needing to master how to care for themselves and their family. This led me to wonder if Disneyland is a solution to help adults relieve stress while simultaneously connecting with their family. I will embark on the intellectual journey of conducting my own research, asking a series of questions and statements on a Likert Scale to middle-aged adults in order to help me draw my own conclusions. All this leads to an excuse to research my happiest place and ask the question: To what extent is Disneyland beneficial in relieving the workaholism attitude and stress of adults between the ages of 45-60?<br><br>

        We Rock The Spectrum: 
          We Rock the Spectrum is a gym catering towards children on the autism spectrum. I worked as both a volunteer and in March 2020 a employee. My duties included: helping children use the gym equipment, assisting with birthday parties, and supporting community groups. I was responsible for checking children in and out of and closing in the evenings.
          We rock the spectrum special events coordinator:
            I planned and organized special holiday events for the gym.  For each event I planned appropriate activities, games, and crafts including creating a schedule and purchasing necessary event supplies. At the events I coordinated and worked the entire event including advertising, setting up,  and cleaning up.<br><br>
        Tutoring
          With the COVID-19 pandemic I provided my services of tutoring to elementary school children.  I assisted them with both classroom and homework assignments.<br><br> 
        CCAC Summer Academy:
          Two week daily enrichment program for the community offering both academic and elective classes for elementary age children. I worked with second grade assisting with teaching lessons involving reading, writing, and math. Ofen, I worked one on one with each child and by the end of the academy they were all writing full sentences<br><br>
        Model United Nations (MUN): 
        	I have been a member of MUN since the 7th grade. As a delegate I have expanded my knowledge of how global issues impact nations differently. I have debated issues such as the ethics of human gene editing, counter terriorism, and the COVID-19 pandemic impact on third-world countries.<br><br>  
        Diabetes Camp: 
         A 4 week virtual internship for college and high school students to learn about biomedical research and academic medicine that focused on diabetes. This program partnered with the American Diabetes Association.
         This internship was led by 17 different diabetes research physicians and experts. During each session I listened and participated in discussions where we discussed various topics<br><br>
        Care Team:
          Care Team is a student-led ministry reaching out to my church‚Äôs middle and high school students. We welcome and support the youth so no one feels left out. During the pandemic we sent birthday cards, created discussion forums, and sent care packages for those having a rough time. Ultimately we were trying to create a sense of community.<br><br>
        Capstone: 
          An academic program focusing on the development of research skills through analysis of scholarly sources. We create and conduct our own research which will be presented in a research paper and oral presentation.<br><br>
